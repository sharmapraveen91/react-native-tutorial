# State Management in React Native

## Introduction

State management in React Native is like organizing items in a smart backpack. Imagine you’re on a hike and need quick access to items like a water bottle, map, and snacks (data). State management ensures you can grab these items without searching through everything—making your app efficient and responsive.

---

## 1. Why Is State Management Important?
- **Global State:** Share data across components (like a shared backpack for everyone).
- **Local State:** Manage state within a single component.
- **Predictable Behavior:** Ensure consistent updates and performance.

---

## 2. Types of State Management

1. **Local State:** Managed within a single component using `useState` or `useReducer`.
2. **Global State:** Shared across components using libraries like **Redux** and **Zustand**.

---

## 3. Redux Example: Global State Management

### 3.1 Installing Redux
```bash
yarn add @reduxjs/toolkit react-redux
```

### 3.2 Setting Up Redux Store
```typescript
// store.ts
import { configureStore } from '@reduxjs/toolkit';
import counterReducer from './counterSlice';

const store = configureStore({
  reducer: {
    counter: counterReducer,
  },
});

export type RootState = ReturnType<typeof store.getState>;
export type AppDispatch = typeof store.dispatch;
export default store;
```

---

### 3.3 Creating a Slice
```typescript
// counterSlice.ts
import { createSlice } from '@reduxjs/toolkit';

interface CounterState {
  value: number;
}

const initialState: CounterState = { value: 0 };

const counterSlice = createSlice({
  name: 'counter',
  initialState,
  reducers: {
    increment: (state) => { state.value += 1; },
    decrement: (state) => { state.value -= 1; },
    incrementByAmount: (state, action) => { state.value += action.payload; },
  },
});

export const { increment, decrement, incrementByAmount } = counterSlice.actions;
export default counterSlice.reducer;
```

---

### 3.4 Using Redux in Components
```typescript
// CounterScreen.tsx
import React from 'react';
import { useSelector, useDispatch } from 'react-redux';
import { RootState } from './store';
import { increment, decrement, incrementByAmount } from './counterSlice';
import { View, Text, Button } from 'react-native';

const CounterScreen = () => {
  const count = useSelector((state: RootState) => state.counter.value);
  const dispatch = useDispatch();

  return (
    <View>
      <Text>Count: {count}</Text>
      <Button title="Increment" onPress={() => dispatch(increment())} />
      <Button title="Decrement" onPress={() => dispatch(decrement())} />
      <Button title="Increment by 5" onPress={() => dispatch(incrementByAmount(5))} />
    </View>
  );
};

export default CounterScreen;
```

---

### 3.5 Wrapping the App with Provider
```typescript
// App.tsx
import React from 'react';
import { Provider } from 'react-redux';
import store from './store';
import CounterScreen from './CounterScreen';

const App = () => {
  return (
    <Provider store={store}>
      <CounterScreen />
    </Provider>
  );
};

export default App;
```

## 4. Do's and Don'ts

✅ **Do's:**
- Use Redux for **complex global state**.
- Keep reducers **pure** and avoid side effects.
- Use **TypeScript** for type safety.

❌ **Don'ts:**
- Don’t store large objects like **images**.
- Don’t update state **directly**—always use actions.
- Avoid **overusing Redux** for simple local states.

---

## 5. Best Practices
- **Use Toolkit:** Simplify Redux with `@reduxjs/toolkit`.
- **Organize Files:** Separate slices into dedicated files.
- **Optimize Performance:** Use `useSelector` carefully to avoid re-renders.
- **Middleware:** Use middleware like **Redux Thunk** or **RTK Query** for async logic.

---

## 6. Use Cases

### ✅ When to Use Redux
- Sharing state across **multiple components**.
- Managing **complex workflows**.
- Handling **asynchronous API calls**.

### ❌ When Not to Use Redux
- Simple local state (use `useState`).
- Small projects where Redux is **overkill**.

## 7. Interview Questions and Answers

1. **What is Redux?**  
A state management library for predictable state updates.

2. **Why use Redux in React Native?**  
To manage global state across components.

3. **What is a Redux Store?**  
A central container holding application state.

4. **How do you update state in Redux?**  
By dispatching **actions**.

5. **What is a Reducer?**  
A pure function that updates state based on actions.

6. **What is Redux Toolkit (RTK)?**  
A simplified version of Redux with less boilerplate.

7. **What is `useSelector` used for?**  
To read state from the Redux store.

8. **What is `useDispatch` used for?**  
To dispatch actions to update state.

9. **Can you use async logic in Redux?**  
Yes, using middleware like **Redux Thunk** or **RTK Query**.

10. **How to avoid re-renders in Redux?**  
Select only the state you need using `useSelector`.

11. **What are the benefits of using Redux Toolkit?**  
Less code, built-in middleware, and better performance.

12. **Is Redux suitable for large-scale apps?**  
Yes, it is ideal for managing complex workflows.

13. **What is an action in Redux?**  
An object that describes a state change.

14. **How do you structure a Redux app?**  
Separate **store**, **slices**, and **components**.

15. **What is Redux DevTools?**  
A browser extension for debugging Redux state.

16. **What is the difference between `useState` and Redux?**  
`useState` is local; Redux is global.

17. **How do you persist Redux state?**  
Using libraries like **redux-persist**.

18. **Is Redux synchronous or asynchronous?**  
Redux is synchronous, but you can handle async with middleware.

19. **What happens if you mutate state directly in Redux?**  
It breaks predictability and may cause bugs.

20. **Can Redux be used with React Native CLI?**  
Yes, it works seamlessly.

## Conclusion
State management is essential for building scalable and maintainable React Native apps. **Redux** is perfect for handling global state and complex workflows, while **Zustand** offers a simpler alternative for smaller projects. Choose the right tool based on your app’s needs!
